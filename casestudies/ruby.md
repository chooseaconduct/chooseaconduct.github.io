# Case Studies of Code of Conduct "Cancel Culture" Out-Of-Control Power Abuse


## Ruby (October, 2021) - A Call for Tolerance On Ruby-Talk Results In Ban On Reddit Ruby


Allow me to restate again I am not the original poster of the
(harmless) joke. I am asking for (more) tolerance.

Now Richard Schneeman sends on r/ruby where I have myself
self-censored because of an anti-crypto mob (the irony is that I am a
crypto-critic - by the way - and try to educate with code examples the
absurdity of it all and so on).

Anyways, for the record let's post the message of the r/ruby ban:

> You have been permanently banned from participating in r/ruby.
> You can still view and subscribe to r/ruby, but you won't be able
>  to post or comment.

> I see that someone said that a joke was harmful to them. I'm disgusted reading the joke. I'm frustrated for my community. I see my co-workers face sexist remarks, and I see them burning out and quitting the programming community. I need programming and especially Ruby, to be inclusive and welcoming. I need programmers not to intentionally post harmful and hateful content.

How absurd. Meanigful change in your behavior. I am asking for
tolerance and for sure that is not negotiable.

Anyways, not expecting any meaningful change from Richard
Schneeman. To repost my answer for the record:

If you follow / read the thread I am NOT the original poster of the
joke. I am asking for tolerance. But reading your
comments above it looks like you are on a "mission". You are targeting
the wrong random nobody (and remember every action will have reactions
and so on). And I thought you are acting in good faith. Helas.

Q: What was the joke (I think most of us don't know it)?

The insanity of it all - here is the posting (not mine as stated before) [from the archive](https://rubytalk.org/t/simple-operations/75577):

Yes, that's all the drama.
Note the last line (above) a harmless statement about the vanity of older women (lying or being shy about their age or such).
