Let's start from the beginning - the mail posted to ruby-talk
titled "

Not sure if I missed a warning.  Obviously this post is about the ruby community and not off-topic.
I was asking about a discussion on a more tolerant moderation policy
first on the ruby reddit and only started due to the recent ban of Opti (who is not a native English speaker) 
with a lead-in about ruby-talk.
