## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) and Answers


### Q: What's the point? That's the whole code? Three words? Where's the enforcement procedure and process? 

**A**: Most code of conducts are page long political manifestos
by "social jacobin revolutionaries / warriors"
that try to enforce a happy la-la-land utopia by self-appointed, self-righteous virtue committees 
with threats and execution 
of social exclusion (and personal destruction). How welcoming. A good argument, a little polemic and you're branded "unprofessional" 
and a persona non grata, a pariah and social outcast.
History tells us how that ends - read up on tyranny or on doublespeak 
(and why free speech is not something to give up lightly.) 
With "human nature is what it is" will misuse for personal vendettas surprise you or that power corrupts?


Thus, if you're looking into adopting a welcoming code of conduct, Choose-A-Conduct offers many alternatives.  
Or inspires you to write your own. 
Remember - Love (not fear) conquers all.
Be the change you want to see in the world. Learn to forgive. Be a mensch (or try to.) Humanitas.
